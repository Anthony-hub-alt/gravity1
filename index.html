    <h1>Gravity</h1>

    <p>
        Gravity is what makes anything stay to the ground on Earth but on other planets/moons there is less gravity which makes it easy to float up in the air. For example on the moon if you jump up in the air your jump will be 5 times higher than it usuallly is.<br>

        Different planets have different forces of gravity, on Earth the force of gravity is strong compared to the moon which is not so strong.

    <h2>Jupiter</h2>


    <p>
        Jupiter's gravitational pull is stronger than Earth because Jupiter is a lot bigger than Earth. Jupiter's pull is 2.4 times stronger than Earth. Even though Jupiter's size is about 318 times than Earth's.

        Let's calculate: Jupiter is 318 times more massive than Earth and 410 million miles away. According to Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation, Jupiter pulls you up 34 million times less than Earth pulls you down. Jupiter's "pull" is utterly feeble.

        So it's all in your mind. But don't let that stop you: give in to the pull!

<h2>Mercury</h2>


<p>
    Mercury's gravitational pull is a lot weaker than Earth's because Earths size is about three times as big. Earth's gravitational pull is 9.807m/s² compared to Mercury's which is only 3.7m/s².

    In fact, Mercury’s mass is approximately 3.3 x 1023 kg (5.5% the mass of Earth) which means that its density – at 5.427 g/cm3 – is the second highest of any planet in the Solar System, only slightly less than Earth’s (5.515 g/cm3). This also means that Mercury’s surface gravity is 3.7 m/s2, which is the equivalent of 38% of Earth’s gravity (0.38 g). This means that if you weighed 100 kg (220 lbs) on Earth, you would weigh 38 kg (84 lbs) on Mercury.

<h2>Neptune</h2>

<p>
    Neptune's gravitational pull is a little bit higher than Earth's because Earth is 4 times smaller than Neptune. Neptune's gravitational pull is 11.15 m/s² and Earths is 9.807 m/s². Neptune is a gas planet, so it doesn’t have a solid surface. If you tried to walk on the surface of Neptune, you’d sink right in. But let’s say you could walk on Neptune. How strong is the gravity on Neptune? How heavy would you feel?

    The surface gravity of Neptune is 1.14 times the gravity on Earth. In other words, if you could actually walk on Neptune, you would feel only a little heavier than if you were walking on Earth. If you weighed 100 kg on Earth, you would weight 114 kg on Neptune. Compare that to the much lower gravity you would feel on the Moon (16.5%) or Mars (37.6%).
